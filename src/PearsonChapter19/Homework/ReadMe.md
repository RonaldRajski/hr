Shuffling and Sorting
For this program, refer to problems 19.8 and 19.9 on page 773. Write a generic method for shuffling the elements in an ArrayList, and a generic method for sorting elements in an ArrayList. To test these methods, make arrays of three different data types, ints, Strings, and Rectangle Objects. Then, call both methods with each array, printing the original, shuffled and sorted orders of each.

For this program, simply submit the java, UML and readme files in a compressed folder.
