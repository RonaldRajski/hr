//    Unbounded wild card in Java Generics
//
//            unbounded wildcards are, as the name suggests, wildcard without and upper or lower bound.  Unbounded wildcard type is specified using the wildcard character (?), for example, List<?>.  This is called a list of unknown type.

//    There are two scenarios where an unbounded wildcard is a useful approach-
//
//    If you are writing a mehod that can be implented using functionality provided in the Object class.
//
//    When the code is using methods in the generic class that doesn't demped on the type parameter. For example, List.size or List.clear, List.isEmpty etc.
